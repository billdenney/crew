Title: A Distributed Worker Launcher
Description: In computationally demanding analysis workflows,
  statisticians and data scientists asynchronously
  deploy long-running tasks to distributed systems,
  ranging from traditional clusters to cloud services
  The 'NNG'-powered 'mirai' R package is a sleek
  and sophisticated scheduler that
  efficiently processes these intense workloads.
  The 'crew' package extends 'mirai' with a unifying
  interface for third-party worker launchers.
  Inspiration also comes from packages
  'future' (2021, <doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-048>), 'rrq',
  'clustermq' (2019, <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz284>),
  and 'batchtools' (2017, <doi:10.21105/joss.00135>).
