\title{workerui: abstract interface specification for semi-persistent
high-performance computing workers}
\description{
The user interface in \code{workerui} is an abstraction for
high-performance computing technologies.
Like the \code{future} R package,
\code{workerui} provides a backend-agnostic standard.
But unlike \code{future}, \code{workerui} prioritizes centralized scheduling,
semi-persistent workers, and user-driven customization.
The user supplies methods to initialize, dispatch, poll,
and terminate a worker on a specific backend technology.
The backend technology could be forked processes,
an on-premises high-performance computing cluster,
a cloud computing service, or even another worker abstraction
like \code{future}. Then, \code{workerui} supplies an \code{R6} subclass to
create objects that manage the actual workers.
Every worker group has a centralized mutable cache
and a centralized registry of all the workers in the group,
both of which are available to the user-defined worker methods.
This facilitates advanced capabilities such as worker affinities
and batched polling. The end goal is to help
pipeline tools such as such \code{targets}
efficiently orchestrate tasks
without having to support individual low-level interfaces to specific
high-performance computing platforms or cloud computing services.
