Package: crew
Title: Centralized Workers
Description: A task queue is a central hub for orchestrating
  computationally demanding workloads dynamically and asynchronously.
  The 'crew' package supports a variety of task queues with
  a common interface and different types of workers for different
  backend technologies, similar to the way the
  'future' package (2021, <doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-048>)
  provides a unified R interface for single jobs and
  individual map-reduce calls. The 'crew' package borrows
  the task queue design from the 'callr' package vignettes and
  <https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/09/callr-task-q/>,
  enhances the core feature set (for example, crash detection),
  and establishes an extensible 'R6' class system to add more worker types
  as development continues (e.g. jobs on Amazon and Google cloud
  computing platforms). Multi-queue structures, such as the
  already-supported 'future'-based task queue, increase
  efficiency in heavily parallel cluster workloads
  with an inner local asynchronous task queue to manage
  task submission, monitoring, and collection.
