The [`R6`](https://r6.r-lib.org) classes of `crew` establish a
standardized user interface to high-performance computing technologies.
Unlike its closely related [`future`](https://future.futureverse.org/)
package, `crew` prioritizes centralized scheduling, semi-persistent
(reusable) workers, and user-driven customization. The primary goal is
to help pipeline tools such as such
[`targets`](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) efficiently orchestrate
tasks without having to support individual low-level interfaces to
specific high-performance computing platforms or cloud services.
