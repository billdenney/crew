Package: crew
Title: A Distributed Worker Launcher
Description: In computationally demanding analysis workflows,
  statisticians and data scientists asynchronously deploy
  long-running tasks to distributed systems, ranging from
  traditional clusters to cloud services.
  The 'NNG'-powered 'mirai' R package is a high-performant
  task scheduler that efficiently processes these intense workloads.
  The role of the `crew` package is merely to extend
  'mirai' to computing platforms beyond local multicore processing.
  With its unifying interface to multiple backends,
  'crew' resembles packages
  'clustermq' (2019, <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btz284>),
  'future' (2021, <doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-048>),
  and 'batchtools' (2017, <doi:10.21105/joss.00135>).
