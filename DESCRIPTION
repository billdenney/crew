Package: crew
Title: Centralized Reusable Workers
Description: The 'R6' classes of 'crew' establish a standardized
  user interface to high-performance computing technologies.
  Unlike the closely related 'future' package
  (2021, <doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-048>), 'crew' prioritizes centralized
  scheduling, heterogeneous semi-persistent workers,
  and user-driven customization. The purpose is to enable pipeline
  tools such as such 'targets' (2021, <doi:10.21105/joss.02959>)
  to efficiently orchestrate tasks without having to support
  individual low-level interfaces to specific high-performance
  computing platforms or cloud services.
