Title: Centralized Interface For Semi-Persistent
  High-Performance Computing Workers
Description: The user interface in 'workerui' is an abstraction for
  high-performance computing technologies.
  Like the 'future' R package (2021, <doi:10.32614/RJ-2021-048>),
  'workerui' provides a backend-agnostic standard.
  But unlike 'future', 'workerui' prioritizes centralized scheduling,
  semi-persistent workers, and user-driven customization.
  The user supplies methods to initialize, dispatch, poll,
  and terminate a worker on a specific backend technology.
  The backend technology could be forked processes,
  an on-premises high-performance computing cluster,
  a cloud computing service, or even another worker abstraction
  like 'future'. Then, 'workerui' supplies an 'R6' subclass to
  create objects that manage the actual workers.
  Every worker group has a centralized mutable cache
  and a centralized registry of all the workers in the group,
  both of which are available to the user-defined worker methods.
  This facilitates advanced capabilities such as worker affinities
  and batched polling. The end goal is to help
  pipeline tools such as such 'targets'
  (2021, <doi:10.21105/joss.02959>) efficiently orchestrate tasks
  without having to support individual low-level interfaces to specific
  high-performance computing platforms or cloud computing services.
