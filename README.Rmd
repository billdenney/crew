The [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq/) package leverages [Redis](https://redis.io), a state-of-the-art transactional in-memory database, to provide a powerful task queue for R. With interprocess communication, automatic down-scaling, and error handling, [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq/) orchestrates tasks at scale. The `crew` package extends [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq/) with components to deploy workers to a variety of distributed computing environments. With its unifying interface to multiple high-performance computing platforms, `crew` resembles packages [`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/), [`future`](https://future.futureverse.org/), and [`batchtools`](https://mllg.github.io/batchtools/).

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("wlandau/crew")
```

## Documentation

Please see <https://wlandau.github.io/crew/> for documentation, including a full function reference and usage tutorial vignettes.

## Similar work

* [`rrqueue`](http://traitecoevo.github.io/rrqueue/): predecessor of [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq/).
* [`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/): sends R function calls as jobs to computing clusters.

## Thanks

The `crew` package incorporates insightful ideas from the following people.

* [Rich FitzJohn](https://github.com/richfitz) and [Robert Ashton](https://github.com/r-ash) developed [`rrq`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/rrq//). `crew` is merely an extension of their work.
* [Gábor Csárdi](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/) developed [`callr`](https://github.com/r-lib/callr) and wrote an [edifying blog post on implementing task queues](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/09/callr-task-q/).
* [Kirill Müller](https://github.com/krlmlr/) created the [`workers`](https://github.com/wlandau/workers) prototype, an initial effort that led directly to the current implementation of `crew`. `crew` would not exist without Kirill's insights about orchestration models for R processes.
* [Henrik Bengtsson](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/). Henrik's [`future`](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/) package ecosystem demonstrates the incredible power of a consistent R interface on top of a varying collection of high-performance computing technologies.
* [Michael Schubert](https://github.com/mschubert/). Michael's [`clustermq`](https://mschubert.github.io/clustermq/) package supports efficient high-performance computing on traditional clusters, and it demonstrates the value of a central `R6` object to manage an entire collection of persistent workers.
* [David Kretch](https://github.com/davidkretch). The [`paws`](https://github.com/paws-r/paws) R package is a powerful interface to Amazon Web Services, and the documentation clearly communicates the capabilities and limitations of AWS to R users.
* [Adam Banker](https://github.com/adambanker), co-authored [`paws`](https://github.com/paws-r/paws) with [David Kretch](https://github.com/davidkretch).
* [David Neuzerling](https://github.com/mdneuzerling). David's [`lambdr`](https://github.com/mdneuzerling/lambdr/) package establishes a helpful pattern to submit and collect AWS Lambda jobs from R.
* [Mark Edmondson](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/). Mark maintains several R packages to interface with Google Cloud Platform such as [`googleCloudStorageR`](https://github.com/cloudyr/googleCloudStorageR) and [`googleCloudRunner`](https://github.com/MarkEdmondson1234/googleCloudRunner), and he [started the conversation](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues/720) around helping [`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) submit jobs to Google Cloud Run.
